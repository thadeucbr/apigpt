# Integração do GPT com Express.js: Gerenciamento de Respostas da API com MongoDB

## Description

This project aims to integrate GPT with Express.js, allowing GPT to manage all API responses and connect directly to a MongoDB database. The goal is to explore the capabilities of GPT tools in a practical application.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js to handle routing and middleware.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing application data.
- **Mongoose**: ODM library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform to create, deploy, and run applications.

## Features

- GPT interprets incoming request body and headers.
- Utilizes a predefined set of tools to generate appropriate responses.
- Manages the entire API lifecycle, from request handling to database interactions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:thadeucbr/apigpt.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd apigpt
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up MongoDB (if not using Docker):
   - Ensure MongoDB is running locally or configure the connection string for a remote database.

5. To run the application using Docker:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

## Usage

- Send requests to the API endpoint, and GPT will interpret the body and headers to provide a response.
- Customize the tools available to GPT for enhanced response generation.
